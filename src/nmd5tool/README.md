nmd5tool
========

nmd5tool - a tool to create and verify file md5 integrity for files

Installation
============

1. Install Node and NPM
2. Install dependencies with 'npm install'
3. Build with 'npm run build' - this will create ../bin/nmd5tool.sh which is a standalone compiled js.

Running
=======

After building, run 'node nmd5tool.sh' on the ../bin compiled file.


Debugging
=========

There is a test.js file here that can be run with 'node test.js', or 'node nmd5tool.js' to run the tool without compiling.
